[lyrics]
> It's the price I have to pay
> for my mind being tired
> for my will being week
> for my body born with needs

> It's ok, I will pay
> I regret what I did
> I am tired of myself
> I will change, yes I will

> I become someone else
> someone good, someone you love
> I am tired of myself
> I will change, yes I will
